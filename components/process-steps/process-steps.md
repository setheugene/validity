## Process Steps
- Heading with repeatable rows
- Each row gets a title and description and will have animated circles next to it while viewer is scrolled to have them visible, one at a time. 

<table class="ll-fields-table">
  <thead>
    <th>Label</th>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
                    <tr>
                      <td>Vertical Spacing Options</td>
                      <td>process_steps_global_spacing_options</td>
                      <td>group</td>
                      <td> (Clone of Utility : Vertical Spacing Options)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>Heading</td>
