# Lifted Logic Base Theme
###### README Version 2.0.0
This document details how to use Lifted Logic's custom WordPress theme.

If you run into issues getting your development environment set up, please contact kyle@liftedlogic.com for assistance. It is vital to use source control properly for themes that are continuously being edited by Lifted Logic and third party developers at the same time.

## Requirements
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Use v16.16.0
  - [Hygen](http://www.hygen.io/) - See /_templates under Theme Structure for help commands
  - [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) - Installed automatically on plugin activation
  - Access to the theme repository on [Buddy](https://app.buddy.works/liftedlogic) (client themes) [Github](https://github.com/liftedlogicllc/base-theme/) (base theme) - Version Control

## Dependencies
  - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility classes used in a majority of the theme. To use these utility classes in CSS files you can reference them using `@apply my-4 text-center;` as an example. Please refer to [their documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for more information on how to use Tailwind.
  - [GSAP](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP) and [ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger) - Used for site animations
  - [Easy Toggle State](https://twikito.github.io/easy-toggle-state/) - JavaScript library for easy toggle state management
  - [Slick Slider](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) - JavaScript library used for carousel sliders
  - [Magnific Popup](https://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/documentation.html) - JavaScript library used for modal popups

## Plugins
  - [Classic Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) - Installed automatically on plugin activation
  - [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) - WordPress plugin used to create forms on the site, installed automatically on plugin activation

## Helpful Tools
  - [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - Allows for quick changing between Node.js versions
  - [Local By Flywheel](https://local.getflywheel.com/) - Easy-to-use complete development environment for WordPress sites
  - [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - GUI client for source control

## Source Control Setup
  - You must have an account set up for you on Buddy before working on a Lifted Logic theme
  - To set up SSH access follow Buddy's [Git SSH keys](https://buddy.works/docs/version-control/ssh-keys) docs
  - Open the theme repository page you are wanting to make changes to. Click Code, Clone, SSH and copy the SSH git url
  - Pull down the repository using SourceTree or your preferred method.
  - Create a branch off of the master branch to do your development. When the work is completed and working properly, merge the branch back into master.

## Theme Deployment
  - [Setting up and deploying a pipeline on Buddy](https://app.tango.us/app/workflow/Adding-a-new-Pipeline-in-Buddy-for-a-New-Build-6735cbfe4294442195919cc6e1e70ad0)

## Development Environment Setup
  - Once the theme has been pulled down, open the theme folder in the editor of your choice
  - Open Terminal, and change directory to the theme folder
  - Ensure you are using node 16 (you can check using `node -v`, if you have Node Version Manager you can switch using `nvm use 16`)
  - Run the command `npm install` to install the theme dependencies
  - Run the command `npm run watch` to begin listening for changes to the .js and .css files (these compile into main.min.css and scripts.min.js)
  - For a shorter compile time, run the command `npm run watch-front` to only compile CSS and JS for the front end of the site
  - Refer to [Starting a New Project](https://liftedlogicdev.wpengine.com/documentation/starting-a-new-project/) on the internal Lifted Logic Dev site for information on activating the theme and starting theme development

## Common Issues
  - If there are version issues that appear when running `npm install`, delete /node_modules folders and rerun `npm install`. Make sure you are using Node version 16.16.0 (`node -v`). Change Node version with Node Version Manager.

## Using components.php
  - Using this will allow you to never have to step foot inside your components.php file again, unless you really want to. If you name your component field name in your flexible content ACF field group the same as your actual component's slug (except with underscores instead of dashes), then it will automatically get the component and the ACF fields.
  - Let's say we've got a Left Right component. We generate the files with our `hygen component new --name "Left Right"` task, which will then name the component `left-right`. In our flexible content field group, we'll give it the field name `left_right`, as usual. This new components.php file will then find the component with that name, replacing underscores with dashes.
  - We will want to name our component fields very similar to what the parameter names (ex. `$component_data['content']`) for the component are. Let's say in Left Right, we have a field for "Content" that is WYSIWYG field. The field name will need to be `"left_right_content"`. Breaking that down, it is `{component_name}_{parameter_name}`.

## LL Component Library
  - In the LL Component Library, there is a tab for each component that says "Installation." Inside of that are two options: SSH and Local Filepath. You can copy the command from there and run it in the terminal for your current site to grab the component that you want.
  - Once you've run your grunt task, it will add the component name to custom-components-list.php. When a user with a liftedlogic.com email enters the backend of the site, those pages will get generated in the Components CPT area.
  - If you included the acf group in your grunt task, you will need to go to your ACF fields in the backend, and sync your new field.

## Component Reference
  - The Component Library plugin will need to be downloaded from Buddy, and added to a site like a normal component. Please give it a nice name, like component-library, and not filename Buddy gives it, which would be something like component-library-abcde12345.
  - See documentation at: http://liftedlogicdev.wpengine.com/snippet/setup-for-component-library-plugin/
  - The name that you gave your component when you generated it will be what shows up in the Components CPT area. If you named your component "One Col", that's still fairly understandable what that component is. However, if it's a Left Right and you gave it the name "lr", it will be difficult to know what that component is without seeing it.
## ACF Special Fields

### Form ID Select Field
  - Create a select field and make sure the Field Name contains `form_id`

### Form Skin Radio Style
  - In the form editor of your ```.form-skin``` form, create a radio button. Select that field, and open the "Appearance" tab. You will see a "Radio Style" field, which will allow you to choose between normal radio styles, and button-ized radio buttons.

### SVG Icon Picker
  - This field will populate with the svg's found in the symbol-defs.svg
  - Create a clone field
  - In Fields search for and select `All fields from Utility : Icon Field field group`
  - If this field is not being used in a repeater or a group, make sure to turn the `Prefix Field Names` option on and have the Field Name contain your component name e.g `content_grid`

### WYSIWYG Background Colors
  - You can either clone the Utility : Background Color field group or create your own field group depending on your situation
  - Clone the Utility : Background Color field group
    - Create a clone field
    - In Fields search for and select `All fields from Utility : Background Color field group`
    - If this field is not being used in a repeater or a group, make sure to turn the `Prefix Field Names` option on and have the Field Name contain your component name e.g `content_grid`
  - Create a field group
    - Create a field with `_background_color` in the field name
    - Select a field type that has options. (Button Group, Select, Radio Button) Set the options for the field to have values that match your background color tailwind classes e.g. `bg-black : Black`
  - The WYSIWYG fields should automatically inherit the classes set for the chosen option
    - If the styles are not showing up you may have to whitelist them in your tailwind config, add them to the admin.css, or investigate further
    - If you need a WYSIWYG to only have a single background color, you can add the background color class to the Presentation > Wrapper Attributes > class option of the WYSIWYG field

### Heading Field
  - This field will provide the ability to set the heading level along with text for seo purposes
  - Create a clone field
  - In Fields search for and select `All fields from Utility : Heading field group`
  - If this field is not being used in a repeater or a group, make sure to turn the `Prefix Field Names` option on and have the Field Name contain your component name e.g `content_grid`
    - If you have multiple headings in one field group, make sure to turn the `Prefix Field Labels` option on and have the Field Label contain a description such as `Sub`, `Small`, `Main`, etc. and update the Field Name as well to contain your prefix e.g. `content_grid_small`
  - To display this field use the following markup
  ```
  <?php
    $heading = $component_data['heading'];
  ?>
  <?php if ( !empty($heading['text']) ) : ?>
    <<?php echo $heading['tag']; ?> class=""><?php echo $heading['text']; ?></<?php echo $heading['tag']; ?>>
  <?php endif; ?>
  ```

### Image Field
  - For use with the fit image component
  - Create a clone field
  - In Fields search for and select `All fields from Utility : Image field group`
  - If this field is not being used in a repeater or a group, make sure to turn the `Prefix Field Names` option on and have the Field Name contain your component name e.g `content_grid`
    - If you have multiple images in one field group, make sure to turn the `Prefix Field Labels` option on and have the Field Label contain a description such as `Small`, `Second`, `Large`, etc. and update the Field Name as well to contain your prefix e.g. `content_grid_small`
  - For easier use set Display from `Seamless` to `Group`
  - To display this field use the following markup for either `Seamless` or `Group` based on your field set up
  - `loading` field  allows you to set whether the image will be lazy loaded or not. Default is set to have lazy loading turned on. It is recommended to set any image above the fold of the initial page load to NOT be lazy loaded. e.g. ` 'loading' => 'eager' `
  ```
  <?php
    // Group
    $image = $component_data['image'];

    // Seamless
    $image_id = $component_data['image_id'];
    $position = $component_data['image_focus_point'];
    $fit = $component_data['image_fit'];
    $loading = $component_data['image_loading'];
  ?>
  <?php
    // Group
    ll_include_component(
      'fit-image',
      array(
        'image_id' => $image['image_id'],
        'position' => $image['image_focus_point'],
        'fit' =>  $image['image_fit'],
        'loading' => $image['image_loading']
      )
    );

    // Seamless
    ll_include_component(
      'fit-image',
      array(
        'image_id' => $image_id,
        'position' => $position,
        'fit' =>  $fit,
        'loading' => $loading
      )
    );
  ?>
  ```
